        Hello! And welcome to this special part of the website. Here I will explain little bit more about myself and some hobbies, passions and other super important stuff about me. 
        <br />
        My name is Bob Ruis, I'm 23 years old and living in a house with my parents. I do have some pets but for their names you need to ask me personally. When I'm at home I spend most of the time behind the computer. I build my own computer and do like the geek side of computers. On the computers I'm working with different kinds of Adobe programs and sublime text(for making this website for example.). I've found a new adventure and that will be starting my own cocktail bar and learning how to be a dj. I will practice both and become pretty good at it, so I believe.

        Great question, thanks for asking! Well besides learning a whole lot of new things I expect learning to work under pressure and collab with other student to create a unique concept, that we may work on after the HCI weeks.
